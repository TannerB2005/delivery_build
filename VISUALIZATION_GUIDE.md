3. Select the file: `postman_deliveries_collection.json`
4. The collection will appear in your sidebar

### 2. Set Environment Variables
1. Create a new environment in Postman
2. Add variable: `base_url` = `http://localhost:3000`
3. Select this environment before running requests

### 3. Test the Setup
1. Ensure your Rails server is running (`rails server`)
2. Try the "Delivery Analytics Dashboard" request first
3. Check the "Visualize" tab in Postman to see charts and graphs

## 📈 Sample Data
The database has been seeded with:
- 5 users with realistic names and emails
- 8 locations across different cities
- 25 deliveries with varied weights and statuses
- 64 items distributed across deliveries
- 50 route locations for delivery paths

**Status Distribution:**
- Cancelled: 7 deliveries
- Delivered: 8 deliveries
- In Transit: 4 deliveries
- Pending: 6 deliveries

**Weight Categories:**
- Light (<10kg): 0 deliveries
- Medium (10-50kg): 17 deliveries
- Heavy (>50kg): 8 deliveries

## 🎨 Visualization Features

### Color Coding
- **Green (#27ae60):** Delivered status, light weight
- **Orange (#f39c12):** In transit status, medium weight
- **Red (#e74c3c):** Heavy weight, urgent items
- **Blue (#3498db):** General information, IDs
- **Gray (#95a5a6):** Pending/inactive status

### Interactive Charts
- Bar charts show relative proportions
- Hover effects and responsive design
- Clean, professional styling
- Mobile-friendly layouts

### Data Tables
- Sortable columns
- Alternating row colors
- Status badges
- Responsive design

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding More Visualizations
You can enhance the visualizations by:
1. Modifying the JavaScript in the "Tests" tab
2. Adding new chart types (pie charts, line graphs)
3. Including more statistical calculations
4. Creating time-series visualizations

### Creating New Endpoints
Add more analytical endpoints in `deliveries_controller.rb`:
```ruby
def daily_stats
  # Add daily delivery statistics
end

def user_performance
  # Add user-specific metrics
end
```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Queries
Use URL parameters for filtering:
- `GET /deliveries?status=delivered`
- `GET /deliveries?user_id=1`
- Add these in your controller for dynamic filtering

### Real-time Updates
Consider adding:
- WebSocket connections for live updates
- Refresh buttons in visualizations
- Auto-refresh capabilities

### Export Capabilities
- Generate PDF reports from visualizations
- Export data to CSV
- Create shareable dashboard links

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Blank visualizations:** Check that the API is returning data
2. **Server errors:** Ensure Rails server is running on port 3000
3. **CORS issues:** Verify CORS is configured in `config/initializers/cors.rb`

### Debugging
- Check the Postman console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API responses in the "Body" tab
- Use browser developer tools for advanced debugging
